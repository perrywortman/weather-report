# Command Line Weather App
Just run this little app from your terminal to display the current conditions and temperature for Central Park. Uses [node.js]() to pull data from the [forecast.io]() weather API. Todo: add ability to pass a zipcode as an argv using the npm module [geocoder](#).

From your terminal run: `node app.js`
